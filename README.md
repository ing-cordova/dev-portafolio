#### Instructions on how to run or use it

**(It is important to have installed Node Js in our computer)**
Firstable, feel free to use it if you want. What you have to do is the following.

1. First you have to execute the command:

```node
npm install
```

2. Second, you have to replace the enviroment variables in order to get the possibilty to interact with clients via email.
**For this, you have to go to https://www.emailjs.com/ and login to get the keys to use in this.**

```
#Setup default environment variables

```

3. Third, you have to execute this command:

Once you have executed those commands, just go to ***portolio.js*** and editing the objects JSON that appears in it. With that, you do not need to change or edit each file in the project.
